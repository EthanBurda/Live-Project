US2381 - I used HTML to add a class to target for CSS to align checklist items to the right of the redline on paper for Studentindex view.

US2385 - I used C# to create a model for MeetupEvents and pushed a migration for the change to the database through the package manager             console.

US2394 - Added an HTML id that was existing elsewhere to provide the desired CSS styling.

US2405 - Restyled the Edit view of the JPChecklist controller to look like a handwritten checklist on notebook paper using HTML, CSS &              C# Razor syntax.

US2407 - Using HTML I created a tag for a dropdown box.

US2408 - Chagned the button value to read "submit" instead of "create" using HTML.

US2410 - Redesigned the carousel to fit the desired view using CSS as well as moving it up into the banner as opposed to below it while             givng the banner more space below so the items weren't so crowded.
